### INTRODUCTION<br>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify;">Grain size measurement  is very important for several reasons. In steels the prior austenitic grain size is a very important character as it affects the hardenability, toughness and other properties. In general, in any alloy and metal, the grain size has a profound effect on the mechanical properties. The hall-petch equation shows that the yield strength of an alloy increases as it's grain size decreases.

        Jefferies Planimetric Method : This method involves counting the number of grains which lie in a rectangular or circular area marked on the microstructure. The grains, which are partly inside the marked area, are counted as half. From this, number of grains per unit area (N<sub>A</sub>) is determined and the grain diameter is calculated from average grain area (A) using the formula:
        d= (A)<sup>1/2</sup> = 1/(N<sub>A</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>
        The grain size is often computed from an ASTM grain size number as:
        N=2n-1
        Where n is ASTM number and N is the number of grains per square inch at 100X.
    </li>

        Heyn's Intercept method : The intercept method involves an actual count ( at least 50 intercepts) of the number of grains intercepted by a test line or the number of grain boundary intersections with a test line, per unit length of test line, used to calculate the mean line intercept length, l-. l- is used to determine the ASTM grain size number, G.
        The precision of the method is a function of the number of intercepts and intersections counted. An intercept is a segment of the test line overlaying one grain. An intersection is a point where a test line is cut by a grain boundary.
        Experiments have shown that a test pattern consisting of three concentric and equally spaced circles having a total circumference of 500 mm gives satisfactory results. Based on the calculation of the number of intercepts, NL and the number of intersections, PL, the mean linear intercept value for each field, l can be calculated:
        l- = l/NL = 1/PL

        ASTM Grain Size Number : This number, the G number, is defined as:
        NAE = 2^Gâˆ’1
        Where NAE is the number of grains per square inch at 100 magnification. 
        To obtain the number per square mm at 1, NA, NAE is multiplied by 15.50. The International Standard Organization (ISO) and in several national standards, the metric grain size number, GM, is based on the number of grains per mm2, at 1, and this gives the equation:
        NA = 8(2^GM)
        The metric grain size number, GM, is a little lower than the ASTM grain size number, G, for the same microstructure:
        G = GM + 0.046
