### INTRODUCTION<br>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify;">Grain size measurement  is very important for several reasons. In steels the prior austenitic grain size is a very important character as it affects the hardenability, toughness and other properties. In general, in any alloy and metal, the grain size has a profound effect on the mechanical properties. The hall-petch equation shows that the yield strength of an alloy increases as it's grain size decreases.

        Jefferies Planimetric Method : This method involves counting the number of grains which lie in a rectangular or circular area marked on the microstructure. The grains, which are partly inside the marked area, are counted as half. From this, number of grains per unit area (NA) is determined and the grain diameter is calculated from average grain area (A) using the formula:
        d= (A)1/2 = 1/(NA)1/2
        The grain size is often computed from an ASTM grain size number as:
        N=2n-1
        Where n is ASTM number and N is the number of grains per square inch at 100X.
