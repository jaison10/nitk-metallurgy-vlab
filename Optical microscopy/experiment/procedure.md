##### These procedure steps will be followed on the simulator

1. Obtain a flat surface on the specimen by belt grinding.<br>

3. Polish the specimen under very light pressure rubbing in forward direction only.<br>

4. Observe the scratches on the specimen. Scratches should not be very deep, but at the same time they should be uniformly in the same direction. When the above condition is satisfactory go to the next finer paper for polishing.<br>

5. After polishing on 4/0 abrasive paper, wash your hands and the specimen and do the fine polishing on the disc polishing unit. <br>
